LeetMetrics is a web application designed to show the progress of a user on LeetCode based on their submitted solutions. By entering a valid LeetCode username, users can view their progress in solving problems across different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) as well as key statistics on their submissions.

Features
Displays user progress in solving problems categorized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Provides submission statistics, including overall submissions and submissions per difficulty level.

Interactive UI with circular progress bars representing the solved problems in each category.

Fetches data using LeetCode’s GraphQL API, allowing real-time tracking of user progress.

Notes
Ensure the username entered is a valid LeetCode username; otherwise, data will not be fetched.

The application uses a proxy server (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com) to bypass CORS restrictions when fetching data from LeetCode’s GraphQL API.
