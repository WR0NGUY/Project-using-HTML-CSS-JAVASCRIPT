Snake Game in JavaScript
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it eats food, and the game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself. You can also start a New Game at any time with a button.

Features
Snake Movement: The snake can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
Growing Snake: Each time the snake eats food, it grows in size.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
New Game Button: Allows you to reset the game and start over at any time.
