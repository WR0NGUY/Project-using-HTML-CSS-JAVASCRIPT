This is a simple web-based stopwatch application that allows you to switch between a stopwatch and a countdown timer. Users can set a specific time (e.g., 5 minutes) for the countdown, and the timer will count down to zero. In stopwatch mode, the timer counts up, just like a regular stopwatch.

Features
Stopwatch Mode: Allows users to count up from 00:00:00 with start, stop, and reset functionality.
Countdown Mode: Allows users to set a specific countdown time in minutes. The timer counts down to zero, alerting the user when time is up.
Time Format: Time is displayed in the HH:MM:SS format.
Mode Toggle: Easily switch between Stopwatch and Countdown modes.
Responsive: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
